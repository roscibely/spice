# Examples of SPICE OPUS Circuit Codes

This repository contains example circuit simulation files using SPICE OPUS formats. These examples demonstrate some electronic circuit designs.

## Contents

- `spice/` — Example circuits for SPICE simulators.
- `README.md` — This file.

## Getting Started

To run the simulations:

### SPICE

1. Use any SPICE-compatible simulator (e.g., LTspice, NGSpice, PSpice).
2. Open the `.cir` files located in the `spice/` folder.
3. Run the simulation according to your simulator’s instructions.


## Example Circuits

- Basic RC filter
- Diode rectifier
- BJT amplifier
- MOSFET switch
- Oscillator circuits
